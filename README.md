## 💼 About Me

Junior QA Analyst with hands-on academic experience in manual testing, API validation, test case design, and defect reporting for web applications and backend services.

Currently expanding my automation testing skills using Selenium, RestAssured, and Appium, supported by a technical background in Java (Spring Boot, Maven) and Python.

Before transitioning into tech, I worked over 13 years as a teacher. This experience strengthened essential QA skills such as:

- Clear communication and documentation
- Analytical thinking and problem solving
- Attention to detail
- Organization and planning
- Team collaboration and adaptability

These skills directly support effective testing, bug reporting, and quality assurance processes.
